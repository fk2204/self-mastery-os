# Productivity, Systems & Deep Work - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Deep work is the superpower** - Focused, distraction-free work produces outsized results
2. **Energy management > time management** - Match tasks to energy levels
3. **Systems beat goals** - Design processes that produce outcomes automatically
4. **Attention is your scarcest resource** - Protect it ruthlessly
5. **Done is better than perfect** - Ship, learn, iterate
6. **The 80/20 rule applies everywhere** - 20% of efforts produce 80% of results
7. **Review loops prevent drift** - Daily/weekly reviews keep you on track

## Deep Work (Cal Newport)

### Deep Work Definition
Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.

### Deep Work Rules
1. **Work Deeply** - Build rituals and routines
2. **Embrace Boredom** - Don't fill every moment with stimulation
3. **Quit Social Media** - If it doesn't substantially support your goals
4. **Drain the Shallows** - Minimize low-value tasks

### Deep Work Scheduling Strategies
| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Monastic | Eliminate all shallow work | Writers, researchers |
| Bimodal | Alternate deep and shallow periods | Academics |
| Rhythmic | Daily deep work at same time | Most knowledge workers |
| Journalistic | Deep work whenever possible | Experienced practitioners |

### Deep Work Session Template
1. Choose one single task
2. Set specific time block (90-120 min ideal)
3. Remove all distractions (phone away, notifications off)
4. Work until timer ends
5. Take genuine break (not phone scrolling)

## Time Blocking & Timeboxing

### Time Blocking Principles
- Every minute of your day should be assigned to a block
- Blocks can be task-specific or theme-based
- Build in buffer blocks for overflow
- Review and adjust blocks throughout day

### Sample Time-Blocked Day
| Time | Block Type | Activity |
|------|------------|----------|
| 6:00-7:00 | Routine | Morning routine |
| 7:00-9:00 | Deep Work | Most important task |
| 9:00-9:30 | Admin | Email, messages |
| 9:30-11:00 | Deep Work | Project work |
| 11:00-12:00 | Shallow | Meetings, calls |
| 12:00-13:00 | Buffer | Lunch, break |
| 13:00-15:00 | Deep Work | Creative work |
| 15:00-16:00 | Admin | Admin tasks |
| 16:00-17:00 | Planning | Tomorrow prep, review |

### Timeboxing vs Time Blocking
- **Time blocking**: Assigning activities to time slots
- **Timeboxing**: Setting fixed time limits for tasks

## GTD (Getting Things Done) Essentials

### The 5 Steps
1. **Capture** - Get everything out of your head into a trusted system
2. **Clarify** - Process what each item means and what to do
3. **Organize** - Put items where they belong
4. **Reflect** - Review regularly to keep system current
5. **Engage** - Take action with confidence

### The 2-Minute Rule
If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.

### GTD Lists
- **Next Actions** - Immediate next steps for active projects
- **Projects** - Outcomes requiring multiple steps
- **Waiting For** - Delegated items awaiting response
- **Someday/Maybe** - Ideas for the future
- **Reference** - Information to keep

### Weekly Review Checklist (GTD)
- [ ] Clear inbox to zero
- [ ] Review calendar (past and upcoming)
- [ ] Review project list
- [ ] Review next actions
- [ ] Review waiting for list
- [ ] Review someday/maybe
- [ ] Get creative: new ideas, projects

## Focus & Distraction Management

### Attention Residue
When you switch tasks, part of your attention stays on the previous task. Minimize switches to maintain focus.

### Distraction Prevention Protocol
1. **Phone**: Different room, or airplane mode
2. **Computer**: Close all unnecessary tabs, use website blockers
3. **Environment**: Door closed, headphones, "do not disturb" signal
4. **Time**: Batch communication to specific times
5. **Mind**: Capture wandering thoughts quickly, return to focus

### The Pomodoro Technique
- Work: 25 minutes
- Break: 5 minutes
- After 4 pomodoros: 15-30 minute break
- Variation: 50 min work / 10 min break for deeper work

## Energy Management

### Energy Audit
| Time of Day | Energy Level | Best Use |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Morning | High | Deep work, important decisions |
| Mid-day | Medium | Meetings, collaboration |
| Afternoon | Lower | Admin, routine tasks |
| Evening | Variable | Planning, light work |

### Energy Multipliers
- Quality sleep (7-9 hours)
- Regular exercise
- Proper nutrition
- Strategic breaks
- Social connection
- Purpose and meaning

### Energy Drains
- Decision fatigue
- Context switching
- Poor sleep
- Dehydration
- Conflict and stress
- Cluttered environment

## Review Loops

### Daily Review (10 min, end of day)
- [ ] What did I accomplish today?
- [ ] What didn't get done? Why?
- [ ] What are tomorrow's top 3 priorities?
- [ ] Clear inbox
- [ ] Update task list

### Weekly Review (60 min, end of week)
- [ ] Review past week's calendar
- [ ] Review completed tasks
- [ ] Review upcoming week's calendar
- [ ] Process all inboxes to zero
- [ ] Review project list and next actions
- [ ] Identify top 3 priorities for next week
- [ ] Review goals and metrics

### Monthly Review (90 min)
- [ ] Review monthly goals progress
- [ ] Analyze productivity patterns
- [ ] Assess system effectiveness
- [ ] Plan next month's priorities
- [ ] Review 90-day goals

### Quarterly Review (Half day)
- [ ] Review 90-day goals
- [ ] Celebrate wins
- [ ] Analyze what worked and didn't
- [ ] Set next 90-day goals
- [ ] Update annual trajectory

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Deep work hours** (daily, weekly)
- **Top 3 completion rate** (did you finish your priorities?)
- **Focus score** (self-rated 1-10)
- **Task completion rate** (completed / planned)
- **Distraction count** (number of times focus broken)
- **Energy level** (morning, afternoon, evening)

## Daily Workflow

### Morning (15-20 min)
1. Review calendar
2. Identify top 3 priorities (one must-complete, two should-complete)
3. Time block the day
4. Clear quick wins (<2 min tasks)

### During Day
1. Follow time blocks
2. Capture new tasks in inbox (don't act immediately)
3. Track deep work hours
4. Take genuine breaks

### Evening (10 min)
1. Process inbox
2. Review what got done
3. Prep tomorrow's plan
4. Shutdown ritual (declare workday done)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No shutdown ritual** - Work bleeds into evening
2. **Checking email first** - Reactive instead of proactive
3. **Too many priorities** - If everything is important, nothing is
4. **Skipping reviews** - System goes stale
5. **No time blocking** - Day happens to you
6. **Multitasking** - Destroys focus, wastes time
7. **Not protecting deep work** - Meetings take over
8. **Perfectionism** - Done > perfect

## Procrastination Solutions

### Understanding Procrastination
Procrastination = avoiding the negative emotion associated with a task

### Anti-Procrastination Strategies
1. **Start with 2 minutes** - Just begin, momentum builds
2. **Make it smaller** - Break into tiny steps
3. **Temptation bundling** - Pair unpleasant task with enjoyment
4. **Remove friction** - Prep everything in advance
5. **Identity shift** - "I'm someone who follows through"
6. **Accountability** - Tell someone your commitment
7. **Time constraint** - Work expands to fill time; give less time

### The 5-Second Rule (Mel Robbins)
When you have an impulse to act, count 5-4-3-2-1 and move. Don't give your brain time to talk you out of it.
