# Lifestyle Design & Environment - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Environment > Willpower** - Design your space to make good choices easy
2. **Friction is powerful** - Add friction to bad habits, remove from good ones
3. **You are the average of your 5** - Your social environment shapes you
4. **Systems beat goals** - Design processes that produce outcomes automatically
5. **Identity drives behavior** - "I am someone who..." is stronger than "I want to..."
6. **Subtraction over addition** - Remove negatives before adding positives
7. **Design your ideal day, then live it** - Don't let days happen to you

## Environment Design Principles

### Make Good Habits Easy
- **Visible**: Put workout clothes by bed, healthy food at eye level
- **Attractive**: Make it appealing (nice gym, good music)
- **Simple**: Reduce steps (prep meals in advance)
- **Satisfying**: Immediate reward (track streak, small treat)

### Make Bad Habits Hard
- **Invisible**: Remove temptations from sight
- **Unattractive**: Reframe the behavior's downsides
- **Difficult**: Add friction (delete apps, unplug TV)
- **Unsatisfying**: Create accountability (public commitment)

## Environment Audits

### Physical Space Audit
| Area | Optimized For | Friction Added To | Score 1-10 |
|------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Bedroom | Sleep | Screens, work | |
| Kitchen | Healthy eating | Junk food | |
| Workspace | Focus, deep work | Distractions | |
| Living area | Rest, social | Mindless scrolling | |

### Digital Environment Audit
- [ ] Phone: Delete time-wasting apps
- [ ] Phone: Notifications off except essential
- [ ] Phone: Grayscale mode (reduces appeal)
- [ ] Computer: Website blockers during work
- [ ] Computer: Clean desktop, organized files
- [ ] Social media: Unfollow negative/time-wasting accounts

### Social Environment Audit
| Person | Energy (+/-) | Aligned Values? | Keep/Reduce/Remove |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Ideal Day/Week Design

### Ideal Day Template
| Time Block | Activity | Energy State |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 5-7 AM | Morning routine, exercise | Building |
| 7-9 AM | Peak work (deep focus) | High |
| 9-12 PM | Important work, meetings | High-Medium |
| 12-1 PM | Lunch, break, walk | Recovery |
| 1-4 PM | Admin, calls, lower-focus work | Medium |
| 4-6 PM | Wrap up, planning, exercise | Winding down |
| 6-9 PM | Personal time, social, hobbies | Relaxed |
| 9-10 PM | Wind down routine | Low |
| 10 PM+ | Sleep | Restore |

### Ideal Week Template
| Day | Theme/Focus |
|-----|-------------|
| Monday | Planning, high-priority projects |
| Tuesday | Deep work, creation |
| Wednesday | Meetings, collaboration |
| Thursday | Deep work, creation |
| Friday | Admin, review, wrap-up |
| Saturday | Personal projects, social |
| Sunday | Rest, preparation, reflection |

## Identity-Based Habit Formation

### The Identity Shift
Instead of: "I want to exercise"
Say: "I am someone who trains daily"

Instead of: "I'm trying to quit smoking"
Say: "I'm not a smoker"

### Building Identity Evidence
1. Decide who you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins
3. Each action is a vote for your identity
4. Accumulate evidence until it becomes belief

### Identity Statements (Templates)
- I am someone who shows up consistently
- I am someone who finishes what I start
- I am someone who takes care of my body
- I am someone who makes money while I sleep
- I am someone who connects deeply with others

## Decision Fatigue Reduction

### Pre-Decisions
- Decide once, execute many times
- Weekly meal plan → no daily food decisions
- Morning routine → no thinking required
- Work uniform → no outfit decisions

### Batching
- Group similar tasks together
- Email: 2-3 times/day at set times
- Errands: One day per week
- Content: Create in batches

### Templates & Checklists
- Create templates for recurring tasks
- Use checklists for complex processes
- Don't reinvent; follow the playbook

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Ideal day adherence** (% of planned activities completed)
- **Environment score** (quarterly audit, 1-10)
- **Decision fatigue** (self-rated, end of day)
- **Energy quality** (correlated with environment)
- **Habit completion rate**

## Daily/Weekly Actions

### Daily
- [ ] Follow morning routine (no decisions)
- [ ] Protect peak energy hours for important work
- [ ] One environment micro-improvement

### Weekly
- [ ] Review and adjust schedule
- [ ] Prepare environment for next week (meal prep, clothes, workspace)
- [ ] Audit digital environment (screen time, app usage)

### Monthly
- [ ] Full environment audit (physical, digital, social)
- [ ] Assess ideal day/week alignment
- [ ] Remove one friction point from good habits
- [ ] Add one friction point to bad habits

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Relying on willpower** - Design environment instead
2. **Keeping temptations "for guests"** - They're for you
3. **Tolerating energy drains** - People, places, things that deplete you
4. **Overcomplicating routines** - Simple and consistent wins
5. **Not batching decisions** - Wastes mental energy
6. **Ignoring digital environment** - Phones are environment too
7. **Delaying environment changes** - Do one thing today

## The "Best Version" Question

When facing any decision, ask:
**"What would the best version of me do here?"**

- Would they hit snooze?
- Would they eat this?
- Would they check their phone now?
- Would they skip the workout?
- Would they respond with anger?

Use this as a compass throughout the day.

## Friction Engineering Examples

| Habit to Build | Remove Friction |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Exercise | Sleep in workout clothes, gym bag ready |
| Healthy eating | Pre-cut vegetables, meal prep |
| Reading | Book on pillow, phone in another room |
| Writing | Document already open, desk clear |

| Habit to Break | Add Friction |
|----------------|--------------|
| Phone scrolling | Delete apps, phone in drawer, grayscale |
| Junk food | Don't buy it, keep it out of house |
| TV binging | Unplug after each use, remove remote batteries |
| Oversleeping | Alarm across room, coffee maker on timer |
