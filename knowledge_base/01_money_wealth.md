# Money & Wealth Creation - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Income is a lagging indicator of value creation** - Focus on providing value; money follows
2. **Leverage multiplies output** - Use code, capital, media, and people to scale beyond your time
3. **Specific knowledge is your moat** - Develop skills that can't be easily trained or outsourced
4. **Multiple income streams reduce risk** - Don't rely on a single source of income
5. **Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep** - Convert active income to passive/semi-passive
6. **Skills stack multiplicatively** - Combine rare skills for unique positioning
7. **Speed of implementation beats perfection** - Take action, iterate, compound

## The Four Types of Leverage (Naval Ravikant)

1. **Labor** - Other people working for you (oldest, lowest leverage)
2. **Capital** - Money working for you (requires resources to start)
3. **Code** - Software that runs 24/7 (zero marginal cost of replication)
4. **Media** - Content that reaches millions (zero marginal cost of replication)

**Goal**: Move from labor-based income to code/media leverage

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Monthly income** (all sources)
- **Income growth rate** (month-over-month, year-over-year)
- **Hours worked per dollar earned** (effective hourly rate)
- **Passive/semi-passive income ratio** (% of income not tied to hours)
- **Skills acquired** (new capabilities added)
- **Network value** (quality connections made)
- **Revenue per customer/client**

## Daily/Weekly Actions

### Daily
- [ ] 1 hour of skill development (learning or practice)
- [ ] 1 outreach/networking action (email, message, call)
- [ ] Review income/opportunity pipeline

### Weekly
- [ ] 2-4 hours on side project or business development
- [ ] Track all income sources and amounts
- [ ] Identify one way to increase hourly rate or leverage
- [ ] Connect with 2-3 valuable contacts

### Monthly
- [ ] Evaluate skill progression - what's improving?
- [ ] Audit time spent vs. income generated
- [ ] Set income targets for next month
- [ ] Review and update income diversification plan

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trading time for money indefinitely** - No path to leverage
2. **Chasing shiny objects** - Jumping between opportunities without mastery
3. **Underpricing services** - Fear-based pricing leaves money on table
4. **Neglecting sales skills** - Everything is sales; nothing happens without it
5. **Waiting for permission** - Start before you're ready
6. **Ignoring distribution** - Great product + no audience = failure
7. **Not tracking numbers** - What gets measured gets managed

## Frameworks & Checklists

### Skill Selection Framework
Ask before investing time in a skill:
- [ ] Is there proven market demand?
- [ ] Can I reach proficiency in <12 months?
- [ ] Does it combine well with my existing skills?
- [ ] Can it be leveraged (code/media/scale)?
- [ ] Does it align with my interests?

### Income Stream Audit
| Stream | Monthly $ | Hours/Month | $/Hour | Leverage Type | Growth Potential |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Job | | | | Labor | |
| Freelance | | | | Labor | |
| Products | | | | Code/Media | |
| Investments | | | | Capital | |

### The "1000 True Fans" Model
- 1000 fans paying $100/year = $100K/year
- Focus on serving a small audience deeply rather than reaching millions superficially
- Build direct relationships with your audience

### Weekly Wealth Review Questions
1. What did I do this week that could compound?
2. Where did I waste time on low-leverage activities?
3. What skill am I building toward mastery?
4. Who did I connect with that could open doors?
5. What's one thing I can automate or delegate?
