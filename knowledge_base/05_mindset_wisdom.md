# Wisdom, Mindset & Emotional Mastery - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **You control your response, not events** - Stoic dichotomy of control
2. **Growth comes from discomfort** - Embrace challenges as training
3. **Thoughts are not facts** - Observe them; don't believe them automatically
4. **Antifragility over resilience** - Aim to grow stronger from stress, not just survive it
5. **Ownership of everything** - Extreme ownership creates power; blame creates weakness
6. **Compounding self-improvement** - Small daily gains = massive long-term change
7. **Your identity shapes your actions** - "I am someone who..." is more powerful than goals

## Growth vs. Fixed Mindset (Carol Dweck)

| Fixed Mindset | Growth Mindset |
|---------------|----------------|
| Ability is static | Ability can be developed |
| Avoids challenges | Embraces challenges |
| Gives up easily | Persists through obstacles |
| Sees effort as pointless | Sees effort as path to mastery |
| Ignores criticism | Learns from criticism |
| Threatened by others' success | Inspired by others' success |

**Key phrase**: Add "yet" to limitations ("I can't do this... yet")

## Stoic Philosophy Essentials

### The Dichotomy of Control (Epictetus)
- **Within control**: Your thoughts, judgments, actions, efforts
- **Outside control**: Other people, outcomes, external events, the past

**Practice**: When stressed, ask "Is this within my control?" Focus energy only on what is.

### Negative Visualization (Premeditatio Malorum)
- Imagine worst-case scenarios briefly
- Reduces fear, increases gratitude
- Prepares you for challenges
- "What if I lost this?" → appreciate what you have

### Memento Mori
- Remember death to appreciate life
- Creates urgency and perspective
- "If this were my last day, would I do this?"

### Amor Fati
- Love your fate
- Everything that happens is necessary for your growth
- Don't just accept difficulties; embrace them

## Antifragility (Nassim Taleb)

| Fragile | Robust | Antifragile |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Breaks from stress | Survives stress | Grows from stress |
| Avoids volatility | Tolerates volatility | Benefits from volatility |
| Needs stability | Handles change | Seeks challenges |

**Goal**: Design life systems that benefit from randomness and stress

### Building Antifragility
- Take small risks often (optionality)
- Expose yourself to low-stakes failure
- Remove fragile dependencies
- Build redundancy (multiple income streams, skills)
- Learn from every setback

## Emotional Regulation Techniques

### The RAIN Method (Tara Brach)
1. **R**ecognize - Name the emotion
2. **A**llow - Let it be present without fighting
3. **I**nvestigate - Where do you feel it? What triggered it?
4. **N**urture - Self-compassion, kindness to yourself

### Cognitive Reframing (CBT)
1. Identify the triggering situation
2. Notice the automatic thought
3. Examine the evidence for/against it
4. Generate alternative interpretations
5. Choose a more balanced thought

### Box Breathing (Navy SEALs)
- Inhale: 4 seconds

### The 10-10-10 Rule
When emotional, ask:
- How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
- How will I feel in 10 months?
- How will I feel in 10 years?

## Key Metrics to Track

- Avoid the paths to failure

### Second-Order Thinking
- What are the consequences of the consequences?
- Think beyond immediate effects

### Regret Minimization (Bezos)

- Minimize regrets, not risks

### The Two Newspaper Test
- Would I be proud if this decision made the front page?
- Would I be ashamed if my inaction made the front page?

## Common Mindset Mistakes

1. **Ruminating on the past** - It's unchangeable; focus on present action
2. **Catastrophizing** - Assuming worst outcome; most fears never happen
3. **All-or-nothing thinking** - Missing the gray areas
4. **Comparing to others** - You see highlights, not struggles
5. **Expecting motivation before action** - Action creates motivation
6. **Avoiding discomfort** - Growth requires discomfort; lean in
7. **Seeking external validation** - Internal standards are more stable
