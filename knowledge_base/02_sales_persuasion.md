# Sales & Persuasion - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Sales is service** - You're helping people solve problems, not manipulating them
2. **Listen more than you talk** - Great salespeople ask questions and understand needs
3. **Objections are buying signals** - They indicate interest; address them, don't avoid them
4. **Follow-up is where deals close** - 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups; most give up after 1-2
5. **Activity creates opportunity** - More conversations = more chances to help and close
6. **Sell the transformation, not the product** - People buy outcomes, not features
7. **Confidence is contagious** - If you don't believe, they won't either

## Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

1. **Reciprocity** - Give value first; people feel compelled to return favors
2. **Commitment/Consistency** - Get small yeses; people stay consistent with prior actions
3. **Social Proof** - Show others are buying/using; people follow the crowd
4. **Authority** - Demonstrate expertise and credentials
5. **Liking** - Build rapport; people buy from those they like
6. **Scarcity** - Create urgency; limited availability increases desire

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Outreach volume** (calls, emails, messages per day/week)
- **Response rate** (% of outreach that gets a reply)
- **Meeting/demo booked rate**
- **Proposal sent rate**
- **Close rate** (% of proposals that convert)
- **Average deal size**
- **Sales cycle length** (days from first contact to close)
- **Revenue per activity** (total revenue / total activities)

## Daily/Weekly Actions

- [ ] Refine scripts based on what's working
- [ ] Study 1 sales book chapter or training

## Objection Handling Framework (LAER)

1. **Listen** - Let them finish completely; don't interrupt
2. **Acknowledge** - "I understand..." or "That makes sense..."
3. **Explore** - Ask clarifying questions to understand the real concern
4. **Respond** - Address the specific objection with evidence/logic

### Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | "Compared to what? Let's look at the ROI..." |
| "Need to think about it" | "Of course. What specifically do you need to consider?" |
| "Not the right time" | "When would be better? Let's schedule for then." |
| "Need to talk to partner/boss" | "Great. Can we schedule a call with them included?" |
| "Already using competitor" | "What would need to change for you to consider switching?" |

## Cold Outreach Best Practices

### Email Structure
1. **Subject**: Short, specific, curiosity-driven (5-7 words)
2. **Opening**: Personalized observation or trigger event
3. **Value prop**: 1-2 sentences on relevant benefit
4. **Social proof**: Quick credibility boost
5. **CTA**: Single, clear next step

### Cold Call Script Framework
1. **Pattern interrupt**: "Hi [Name], did I catch you at a bad time?"
2. **Reason for call**: "Reason I'm calling is..."
3. **Permission**: "Can I have 30 seconds to explain why, then you can decide if we should talk more?"
4. **Pitch**: Problem → Solution → Proof → Ask

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Talking too much** - Aim for 60% listening, 40% talking
2. **Not qualifying leads** - Wasting time on poor fits
3. **Fear of follow-up** - You're not being annoying; you're being helpful
4. **Taking rejection personally** - It's a numbers game
5. **Not asking for the close** - You have to actually ask for the sale
6. **Discounting too quickly** - Defend your value before negotiating price
7. **Neglecting existing customers** - Upsells and referrals are easier than new leads

## Pipeline Management

### Sales Stages
1. **Prospect** - Identified potential lead
2. **Contacted** - Initial outreach made
3. **Qualified** - Confirmed fit, budget, authority, need
4. **Demo/Meeting** - Presented solution
5. **Proposal** - Sent formal offer
6. **Negotiation** - Discussing terms
7. **Closed Won/Lost** - Deal complete

### Weekly Pipeline Review
- How many prospects at each stage?
- What's the dollar value at each stage?
- What deals are stalled? Why?
- What's needed to move deals forward?
