# Smart Ideas, Business & Career Strategy - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Validate before building** - Talk to customers before writing code or investing heavily
2. **Stack complementary skills** - Combine technical, communication, strategic, and creative abilities
3. **Always negotiate** - 66% who ask get what they want; those who don't leave money on table
4. **Use frameworks consistently** - ICE/RICE for ideas, Build-Measure-Learn for execution
5. **Scale strategically** - Grow when numbers prove readiness, not when enthusiasm peaks
6. **Track meaningful metrics** - Avoid vanity metrics; focus on indicators tied to outcomes
7. **Build relationships continuously** - Key career turning points often come through connections

## Idea Evaluation Frameworks

### ICE Score (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- **Best for**: Quick experiments, growth hacking, rapid iteration
- **Formula**: ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease
- **Scale**: 1-10 for each factor

| Idea | Impact (1-10) | Confidence (1-10) | Ease (1-10) | ICE Score |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| | | | | |

### RICE Score (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
- **Best for**: Product features, roadmap prioritization
- **Formula**: RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

| Idea | Reach | Impact (0.25-3) | Confidence (%) | Effort (weeks) | RICE |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------|
| | | | | | |

**Impact scale**: 0.25=Minimal, 0.5=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High, 3=Massive

## Lean Startup Methodology

### Build-Measure-Learn Loop
1. **Build** a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
2. **Measure** real-world results with defined KPIs
3. **Learn** from user feedback
4. **Decide**: Pivot or persevere

### MVP Types
- **Concierge MVP**: Manually deliver the experience before building tech
- **Landing Page MVP**: Validate demand before building product
- **Process MVP**: Use spreadsheets and existing tools before custom dev

### Experiment Tracking Template
| Hypothesis | Test Method | Success Criteria | Timeline | Result | Learning |
|------------|-------------|------------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Customers want X | Landing page | 100 signups | 2 weeks | | |

## Career Capital & Skill Stacking

|----------------|---------------------|--------|-----|----------|
| Technical | | | | |
| Communication | | | | |
| Strategy | | | | |
| Creative | | | | |
