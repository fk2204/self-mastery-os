# Dating, Social Skills & Relationships - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Social skills are skills** - They can be learned and improved with practice
2. **Rejection is information, not identity** - It's about fit, not your worth
3. **Volume creates opportunities** - More interactions = more chances to connect
4. **Be genuinely interested** - Curiosity about others beats trying to be interesting
5. **Lead with value** - Give energy, attention, and positivity first
6. **Standards protect you** - Know your non-negotiables; don't compromise on them
7. **Vulnerability creates connection** - Authenticity beats performing

## The Hierarchy of Social Needs

1. **Basic social competence** - Can hold conversations, not awkward
2. **Likability** - People enjoy your company
3. **Deeper connections** - Meaningful friendships and relationships
4. **Social abundance** - Options, networks, community
5. **Social mastery** - Influence, leadership, charisma

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Weekly social events attended**
- **New conversations initiated**
- **Quality time with close relationships**
- **Dates (if dating)**
- **Follow-ups sent/received**
- **Social comfort level** (self-rated 1-10)
- **Network growth** (new meaningful connections)

## Daily/Weekly Actions

### Daily
- [ ] One genuine compliment to someone
- [ ] One conversation with a stranger or acquaintance
- [ ] Reach out to one existing connection (text, call)

### Weekly
- [ ] Attend 1-2 social events or activities
- [ ] Initiate plans with friends (be the organizer)
- [ ] Practice one social skill focus area
- [ ] Reflect on interactions: what went well, what to improve

### Monthly
- [ ] Meet 2-3 new people through expanded activities
- [ ] Deepen 1-2 existing relationships (longer hangout, deeper conversation)
- [ ] Evaluate social circle: who energizes vs. drains you?

## Conversation Framework (FORD)

Use these topics to keep conversations flowing:
- **F**amily - Where are you from? Siblings? Background?
- **O**ccupation - What do you do? What do you enjoy about it?
- **R**ecreation - Hobbies? What do you do for fun? Travel?
- **D**reams - Goals? Bucket list? What's next for you?

### Conversation Starters
- "What's the most interesting thing that happened to you this week?"
- "What are you working on that you're excited about?"
- "How do you know [host/mutual friend]?"
- "What got you into [their hobby/profession]?"

### Active Listening Signals
- Eye contact (not staring, natural breaks)
- Nodding and verbal affirmations ("right," "interesting")
- Follow-up questions based on what they said
- Paraphrasing: "So what you're saying is..."

## Dating-Specific Guidance

### Where to Meet People
1. **Social hobbies** - Sports leagues, dance classes, hiking groups
2. **Events** - Meetups, conferences, parties
3. **Apps** - Hinge, Bumble (used strategically)
4. **Through friends** - Social circle expansion
5. **Cold approach** - Requires more skill, higher risk/reward

### Dating App Best Practices
- Quality photos (natural, good lighting, show lifestyle)
- Specific, conversation-starting bio

- Move to meeting quickly (within 1-2 weeks of matching)

### First Date Principles
- Activity-based > sit-down dinner (lower pressure)
- Keep it short (coffee/drinks, 1-2 hours max)
- Focus on having fun, not impressing
- Ask questions, be curious
- Make a decision by the end (interested or not)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Waiting to "feel ready"** - Start practicing now, improve as you go

3. **Putting people on pedestals** - They're humans, not prizes
4. **Ignoring red flags** - Trust your gut; don't rationalize bad behavior
5. **Making someone your whole life** - Maintain independence and other relationships
6. **Fear of rejection** - Reframe as data collection, not failure

## Social Confidence Builders

### Before Social Events
- Set a concrete goal (e.g., "I will talk to 3 new people")

- Arrive early (easier to integrate)
- Give yourself permission to leave after 1 hour

## Reflection Questions

### After Interactions
1. What did I do well?
2. What could I have done differently?
3. What did I learn about this person?
4. What did I notice about my emotional state?
5. What will I try next time?
