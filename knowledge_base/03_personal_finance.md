# Personal Finance & Investing - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Spend less than you earn** - The foundation of all wealth building
2. **Pay yourself first** - Automate savings before spending
3. **Avoid high-interest debt** - Consumer debt destroys wealth
4. **Time in market beats timing the market** - Start early, stay consistent
5. **Diversification reduces risk** - Don't put all eggs in one basket
6. **Fees compound negatively** - Low-cost index funds outperform most active managers
7. **Your biggest asset is your income** - Invest in skills that increase earning power

## Budgeting Systems

### 50/30/20 Rule
- **50%** Needs (housing, food, utilities, minimum debt payments)
- **30%** Wants (entertainment, dining, hobbies)
- **20%** Savings & Debt payoff (investments, emergency fund, extra debt payments)

### Zero-Based Budgeting
- Every dollar has a job
- Income - Expenses = $0
- Best for those who need detailed control
- Tools: YNAB, EveryDollar

### Pay Yourself First
1. Set savings target (aim for 20%+)
2. Automate transfer on payday
3. Live on what remains
4. Increase savings rate with each raise

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Net worth** (assets - liabilities) - monthly
- **Savings rate** (% of income saved/invested)
- **Debt-to-income ratio**
- **Emergency fund months** (months of expenses covered)
- **Investment returns** (vs. benchmark)
- **Monthly cash flow** (income - expenses)

## Emergency Fund Targets

| Situation | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Stable job, dual income | 3 months expenses |
| Single income, stable | 6 months expenses |
| Variable income/freelance | 6-12 months expenses |
| Business owner | 12+ months expenses |

## Debt Payoff Strategies

### Avalanche Method (Mathematically Optimal)
1. List debts by interest rate (highest first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put extra money toward highest interest
4. Repeat until debt-free

### Snowball Method (Psychologically Optimal)
1. List debts by balance (smallest first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put extra money toward smallest balance
4. Quick wins build momentum

## Investment Fundamentals

### Asset Allocation by Age (Rule of Thumb)
- Stocks: 110 - Your Age = Stock %
- Example: Age 30 → 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- Adjust based on risk tolerance and timeline

### Core Portfolio Strategy
- **US Total Stock Market Index** (50-60%)
- **International Stock Index** (20-30%)
- **Bond Index** (10-30% based on age)
- Keep it simple; avoid complexity

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts Priority
1. **401(k) to employer match** - Free money
2. **HSA** (if eligible) - Triple tax advantage
3. **Roth IRA** - Tax-free growth
4. **401(k) max** - Additional tax-deferred
5. **Taxable brokerage** - After tax-advantaged is maxed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No emergency fund** - One crisis away from debt spiral
2. **Lifestyle inflation** - Spending every raise instead of saving
3. **Timing the market** - Missing best days destroys returns
4. **High-fee investments** - 1% fee = hundreds of thousands lost over career
5. **Not starting early** - Compound interest needs time
6. **Carrying credit card balances** - 20%+ interest destroys wealth
7. **No automation** - Relying on willpower fails
8. **Checking portfolio daily** - Leads to emotional decisions

## Financial Independence Numbers

### The 4% Rule
- Annual expenses × 25 = FI number
- Example: $50K/year expenses → $1.25M needed
- Can withdraw 4% annually with low failure risk

### Coast FI
- Invest enough early that compound growth reaches your FI number
- Can then "coast" without additional contributions
- Reduces pressure in middle career years

## Simple Frameworks

### Before Major Purchase Checklist
- [ ] Can I pay cash?
- [ ] Have I waited 48+ hours?
- [ ] Will I still want this in 6 months?
- [ ] What's the cost per use?
- [ ] Does this align with my values/goals?
