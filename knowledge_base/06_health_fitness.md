# Health, Fitness & Energy - Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

1. **Sleep is the foundation** - Everything else suffers without quality sleep
2. **Consistency beats intensity** - Regular moderate exercise > sporadic extreme workouts
3. **Strength training is non-negotiable** - Builds muscle, bone, metabolism, longevity
4. **Protein is the priority macro** - Most people under-eat protein
5. **Movement throughout the day** - Don't let 1 hour of exercise offset 10 hours of sitting
6. **Recovery is when growth happens** - Training is stimulus; rest is adaptation
7. **Energy management = life management** - Protect and optimize your energy

## Sleep Optimization (Andrew Huberman / Matthew Walker)

### Sleep Fundamentals
- **Target**: 7-9 hours for most adults
- **Consistency**: Same wake time daily (even weekends) ±30 min
- **Temperature**: Cool room (65-68°F / 18-20°C)
- **Darkness**: Complete darkness or sleep mask
- **Timing**: Get morning sunlight within 30 min of waking

### Sleep Hygiene Checklist
- [ ] No caffeine after 2 PM (or 8-10 hours before bed)
- [ ] No alcohol within 3 hours of bed
- [ ] No screens 1 hour before bed (or use blue blockers)
- [ ] No large meals 2-3 hours before bed
- [ ] Cool, dark, quiet room
- [ ] Consistent bedtime routine

### If You Can't Sleep
- Get up after 20 minutes of lying awake
- Do something boring in dim light
- Return when sleepy
- Don't check phone or screens

## Workout Programming

### Minimum Effective Dose
- **Strength**: 2-3 sessions/week, 45-60 min
- **Cardio**: 150 min moderate OR 75 min vigorous per week
- **Mobility**: 10-15 min daily

### Simple Strength Template (3 Days)
**Day A - Push Focus**
- Horizontal Push (Bench/Push-ups): 3x8-12
- Vertical Push (Overhead Press): 3x8-12
- Squat Variation: 3x8-12
- Tricep Accessory: 2x12-15

**Day B - Pull Focus**
- Horizontal Pull (Rows): 3x8-12
- Vertical Pull (Pull-ups/Lat Pulldown): 3x8-12
- Hip Hinge (Deadlift/RDL): 3x8-12
- Bicep Accessory: 2x12-15

**Day C - Full Body**
- Squat or Lunge: 3x10
- Push (Any): 3x10
- Pull (Any): 3x10
- Core: 3x15

### Progressive Overload
- Add weight when you can complete all reps with good form
- Increase by smallest increment available
- Track every workout

## Nutrition Fundamentals

### Protein Priority
- **Target**: 0.7-1g per pound of bodyweight
- **Timing**: 25-40g per meal, spread across day
- **Sources**: Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, tofu

### Simple Plate Method
- **1/2 plate**: Vegetables
- **1/4 plate**: Protein
- **1/4 plate**: Carbohydrates
- **Thumb-sized**: Healthy fats

### Hydration
- Target: Half your bodyweight in ounces (or 2-3 liters)
- More if active or hot climate
- First thing in morning: 16oz water

### Meal Timing (Basic)
- Don't skip breakfast if it affects your energy
- Larger meals earlier in day if possible
- Don't eat huge meals before bed

## Daily Energy Optimization

### Energy Audit Questions
1. How's my sleep quality?
2. Am I eating enough protein?
3. Am I moving enough?
4. Am I hydrated?
5. Am I over-caffeinated?
6. Am I mentally drained (stress, decisions)?

### Energy Management Protocol
| Time | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| Morning | Sunlight, cold water, protein breakfast |
| Mid-morning | Peak focus work, minimize meetings |
| Post-lunch | Light movement, avoid sugar crash |
| Afternoon | Strategic caffeine if needed (not after 2PM) |
| Evening | Wind down, reduce blue light, prep for sleep |

### The 20-20-20 Rule (Eye/Energy)
Every 20 minutes:
- Look at something 20 feet away
- For 20 seconds
- Bonus: Stand and move

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Sleep hours** (nightly)
- **Sleep quality** (1-10 subjective)
- **Energy level** (1-10, AM and PM)
- **Workouts completed** (per week)
- **Steps** (daily)
- **Water intake**
- **Protein grams** (daily)
- **Body weight** (weekly, same conditions)

## Daily/Weekly Actions

### Daily Non-Negotiables
- [ ] 7+ hours sleep
- [ ] Morning sunlight (10-15 min)
- [ ] Move/walk (8,000+ steps)
- [ ] Protein at every meal
- [ ] 2+ liters water

### Weekly
- [ ] 3 strength training sessions
- [ ] 2-3 cardio sessions (can be walks)
- [ ] 1 rest/recovery day minimum
- [ ] Meal prep or planning

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sacrificing sleep for workouts** - Counterproductive; rest is crucial
2. **Skipping strength training** - Cardio alone isn't enough
3. **Overcomplicating diet** - Eat whole foods, enough protein, done
4. **Weekend warrior syndrome** - Consistency > intensity
5. **Ignoring recovery** - No deloads, no rest days
6. **Relying on motivation** - Build systems and habits instead
7. **All-or-nothing** - Some movement is always better than none

## Quick Health Wins

### If You Only Have 10 Minutes
- 10 min walk
- 10 min bodyweight circuit
- 10 min stretching/mobility
- 10 min meditation (mental health)

### If You Missed a Workout
- Don't skip entirely; do 50% of planned
- A 20 min workout is infinitely better than 0
- Movement is the goal, not perfection

## Recovery Protocols

### Active Recovery
- Light walking
- Swimming
- Yoga or stretching
- Foam rolling

### Sleep Recovery
- Prioritize 7-9 hours
- Nap if needed (20 min max, before 3PM)
- Reduce training volume if consistently under-sleeping

### Stress Recovery
- Nature exposure
- Social connection
- Play and laughter
- Breathing exercises
